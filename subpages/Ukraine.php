                <h3><center>Why Ukraine Matters</center></h3>
                <p style="font-size: 90%;">
                Ukraine is a sovereign nation that has been under constant threat from Russia for decades. Russia has violated Ukraine's territorial integrity, supported armed separatists, launched missile 
                attacks, and caused immense suffering to the Ukrainian people.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 90%;">
                Ukraine matters because it is a European country that shares common values with the West, such as democracy, human rights, and rule of law. Ukraine is also a strategic partner of NATO and 
                the EU, contributing to regional security and stability. Ukraine has a rich and diverse culture, history, and identity, which deserves respect and recognition.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 90%;">
                Russia has repeatedly violated international law and norms, as well as its own commitments under various agreements. Russia has annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, in a blatant act of aggression 
                that was condemned by the international community. Russia has also supported pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, who have been fighting the Ukrainian military since 
                2014. Russia has provided them with weapons, troops, and mercenaries, as well as propaganda and disinformation.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 90%;">
                Russia has also escalated the conflict by launching missile strikes across Ukraine, targeting civilian infrastructure and population centers. Russia has used hypersonic missiles that are hard to 
                intercept and cause massive damage. Russia has also endangered the safety of nuclear power plants in Ukraine, by cutting off their power supply and exposing them to potential accidents. Russia has 
                also committed war crimes and human rights violations in Ukraine, such as torture, executions, kidnappings, and looting.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 90%;">
                Russia's actions are driven by its imperial ambitions and its fear of losing influence in its former sphere of domination. Russia wants to keep Ukraine weak and dependent, and prevent it from 
                integrating with the West. Russia also wants to undermine the credibility and cohesion of NATO and the EU, by sowing doubt and division among their members. Russia also wants to assert its power 
                and prestige on the global stage, by challenging the US-led world order.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 90%;">
                Russia's actions are not only wrong but also counterproductive. Russia has isolated itself from the international community, facing sanctions, condemnation, and isolation. Russia has also 
                alienated its own people, who are suffering from economic hardship, political repression, and social discontent. Russia has also wasted its resources and potential on a futile war that has no 
                clear end or purpose.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 90%;">
                Ukraine deserves our support and solidarity in its struggle for freedom, sovereignty, and dignity. Ukraine needs our help to defend itself from Russian aggression, to rebuild its economy and 
                society, and to pursue its European aspirations. Ukraine also needs our help to promote dialogue and diplomacy, to find a peaceful solution to the conflict, and to restore its territorial integrity.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 90%;">
                We cannot let Russia get away with its crimes and violations. We must stand up for Ukraine and for our shared values and interests. We must show Russia that it cannot bully or intimidate us or our 
                allies. We must show Russia that it will pay a high price for its aggression and interference. We must show Russia that it is on the wrong side of history.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 95%;">
                Glory to Ukraine!
