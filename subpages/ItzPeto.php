                ItzPeto.com is not just a website, as I've decided to host a Beta 1.7.3 Minecraft server that offers basic survival gameplay. Reason for hosting such an old
                version of Minecraft is simple: You can run it anywhere. Even on the worst devices you can possibly think of. Another reason is that because Beta has it's own
                vibe and feel that you can explore for yourself. If you want to join the server, you can copy the IP address by clicking the button below.
